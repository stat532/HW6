### Q1. (10 points)

Assume you are fitting multivariate data with a multivariate normal distribution. Using a multivariate normal on the mean vector and an inverse-Wishart distribution as a prior for the covariance matrix, derive the full conditional distributions for the mean and covariance matrices.

### Q2. (5 points)

Propose a dataset to use for the course project. Include a summary or description of the structure of the data along with the research question you hope to address.
